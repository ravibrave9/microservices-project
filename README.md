# Microservices Project with Node.js

This project demonstrates the implementation of microservices architecture using Node.js. 
It consists of two microservices: one for product management and another for order management. 
These microservices communicate with each other to create orders for products.


API Endpoints:

Product Service
POST /products: Create a new product
GET /products: Get all products

Order Service
POST /orders: Create a new order
GET /orders: Get all orders
